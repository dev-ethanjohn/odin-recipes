        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Buko pie is a traditional Filipino dessert consisting of a flaky pastry filled with a rich mixture of young coconut meat and a creamy, sweet custard. It's a popular delicacy appreciated for its delightful blend of textures and tropical taste.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Flaky Pie Crust</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups flour, sifted</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¾ cups lard,chilled</li>
            <li>6 tablespoons cold water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice or vinegar</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Pie Filling</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ cup coconut water</li>
            <li>½ cup all-purpose cream</li>
            <li>¾ cup sugar</li>
            <li>4 cups young coconut meat</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Egg Wash</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 small egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon milk</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Pie Filling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dissolve the cornstarch in coconut water and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan over medium-low heat, combine the cream and sugar and bring to a simmer. Cook until sugar is completely dissolved.</li>
            <li>Add the coconut meat. </li>
            <li>Slowly add the coconut water with cornstarch, stirring regularly. Cook, stirring frequently, for about 3 to 5 minutes or until the sauce thickens to almost paste-like consistency.</li>
            <li>Remove from heat and allow to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Flaky Pie Dough</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a bowl, sift flour and salt. </li>
            <li>Add chilled lard and cut in with a knife until resembling small peas. Make sure they are not too small or the crust will be crumbly. </li>
            <li>Add lemon juice or vinegar to the cold water and sprinkle in just enough cold water to the flour mixture, while tossing lightly with a fork, to form a ball. </li>
            <li>Chill, if possible, to make for easier handling. Divide into two equal parts, one for the bottom and one for the top crust.</li>
            <li>Take 1 part of the pie dough and place it on a floured surface. Roll it out thinly to fit a 28x4 cm pie pan with additional inch allowance for the edges. </li>
            <li>Gently fold the rolled dough in half and then in a quarter. Place the dough on top of the pie pan with the pointed part precisely in the middle. Unfold the pie dough and gently fit the dough on the bottom and sides of the plate without tearing it. </li>
            <li>Using kitchen shears, trim dough to a 1-inch overhang; fold under, and press gently to seal. Crimp edges if desired. Refrigerate 30 minutes to an hour before using.</li>
            <li>Take the remaining half of the dough and roll it forming a circle with the same diameter as the top of the pie pan (28cm). Place the dough on parchment paper and roll it together into a cylinder. Refrigerate until ready to use. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Assembly and Baking</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat to 425 F.</li>
            <li>Pour the filling on the chilled pie crust, making sure that the coconut meat is evenly distributed. </li>
            <li>Unroll the second crust dough with the parchment paper to cover the top of the pie. Cut the excess from the edges, if any, and pinch the sides to seal together with the crust. </li>
            <li>Using tines of a fork, poke holes on top crust to serve as vents for the steam while baking.  </li>
            <li>Bake in a 425 F oven for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl,  whisk together the egg and milk.  Remove the pie from oven and brush the top with the egg wash.</li>
            <li>Lower the temperature to  350 F and bake for another 30-40 minutes. </li>
            <li>Remove pie from oven and let it cool down for the filling to set. Serve warm or cold.</li>
        </ol>
