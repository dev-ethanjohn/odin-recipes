        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Adobo's irresistible blend of chicken savory, tangy, and umami flavors, along with its rich history and cultural significance, makes it a bomb of flavor in Filipino cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup white Filipino can vinegar, or distilled white vinegar</li>
            <li>6-8 cloves garlic (smashed with the side of a knife and peeled)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon whole black peppercorns</li>
            <li>2 bay leaves</li>
            <li>6 skin-on bone-in chicken thighs</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Palce the soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, black peppercorns, and bay leaves in a large, nonreactive saut√© pan, and then nestle the chicken thighs, skin side down, into the pan.</li>
            <li>Bring the liquid to a boil over high heat, and then cover and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken over, and then cover and simmer for another 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Uncover the pan, and then increase the heat to high and return the sauce to a boil. While occasionally turning and basting the chicken, continue boiling the sauce, uncovered, until it is reduced by half and thickens slightly, 5-7 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with steamed white rice.</li>
        </ol>
